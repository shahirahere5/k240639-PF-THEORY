Binary to Decimal: Loop through each bit of the binary string, multiplying each bit by 2 raised to the power of its position, and summing the results to obtain the decimal value.

Decimal to Binary: Continuously divide the decimal number by 2, recording the remainder each time, and reverse the order of remainders to get the binary representation.

Hexadecimal to Decimal: Loop through each hexadecimal digit, converting it to its decimal equivalent by multiplying by 16 raised to the power of its position, and summing the results.

Decimal to Hexadecimal: Repeatedly divide the decimal number by 16, recording the remainder, converting values 10-15 to their corresponding hexadecimal letters (A-F), and reversing the order of results.

Hexadecimal to Binary: For each hexadecimal digit, use a switch-case structure to map it directly to its 4-bit binary equivalent, concatenating the results.

Binary to Hexadecimal: Group the binary string into sets of four bits (starting from the right), convert each group to its hexadecimal equivalent, and concatenate the results.


I learned how to effectively implement and understand base conversions between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal systems, enhancing my grasp of number representation in computing. Additionally, I gained practical experience in handling string input and using control structures in C for systematic data processing.
