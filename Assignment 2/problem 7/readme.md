Filling the Array: The fill_table function populates a 6x5 character array with random uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z' and places the digits "0639" in the last row.
Displaying the Array: The display function prints the current state of the character array.
Searching for Strings: The search function checks for the presence of a user-input string in the array, both horizontally and vertically. It returns 1 if found and 0 if not.
User Interaction: In the main function, the program continuously prompts the user to enter a string to search. If "END" is entered, the character array is repopulated, and the search resumes.


I learned how to create and manipulate 2D arrays in C, handle user input for dynamic interaction, and implement basic string searching algorithms, enhancing my understanding of array operations and user interface design in console applications.
