Horizontal Histogram:

The HorizontalHistogram function prints each number as a row of asterisks, where the number of asterisks corresponds to the value in the numbers array.
Vertical Histogram:

The VerticalHistogram function first finds the maximum value in the array, then prints rows from the top down, placing an asterisk for each column where the number meets or exceeds the current row index. It concludes by displaying the actual values below the histogram.


I learned how to create both horizontal and vertical histograms using loops and conditionals in C, effectively visualizing numerical data.
