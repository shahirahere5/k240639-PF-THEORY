The program iterates through each slogan, creating a frequency array to count character occurrences. It then prints each character's frequency in a dictionary format while ensuring duplicate characters are not printed multiple times.


I learned how to effectively use a frequency array to analyze character counts in strings and handle duplicate characters to display each one only once.
