The program utilizes a character counting technique to group anagrams from a list of strings. For each unique string, it counts the characters and compares them with the other strings, marking anagrams as grouped to avoid redundant checks.

 learned how to efficiently group anagrams by leveraging character frequency arrays and how to implement logic to avoid processing already grouped elements, enhancing my understanding of string manipulation and algorithm optimization in C.
