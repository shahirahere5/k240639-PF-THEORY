Winning Condition: The function firstMove checks if the total number of matchsticks is a multiple of 5. If it is, player A cannot guarantee a win with optimal play from player B, so the function returns -1.
Optimal Move Calculation: If the total is not a multiple of 5, the function calculates and returns the number of matchsticks player A should pick on their first turn to ensure a winning strategy, which is matchsticks % 5.

I learned how to analyze game theory scenarios in programming to devise optimal strategies and how simple mathematical operations can determine winning moves in games involving finite resources.
