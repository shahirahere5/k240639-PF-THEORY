Game Design: Created a simple grid adventure game with a 5x5 character grid for player movement and item collection.
Grid Representation: Used a 2D array to represent the game board, defining characters for different entities.
Input Handling: Implemented a loop for user commands (W, A, S, D, Q) and checked for valid input.
Player Movement: Developed functions for vertical (up/down) and horizontal (left/right) movement, ensuring valid moves.
Boundary Checks: Added checks to prevent moving outside the grid.
Item Collection: Integrated item collection when the player moves to a cell with an item ('I').
Grid Display: Created a function to display the grid after each move for visual feedback.
Game Termination: Allowed quitting the game with 'Q' and displayed the collected items.


i learnt input handling and user feedback.
