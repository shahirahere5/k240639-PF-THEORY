The program iterates through each word, tracking consecutive duplicate characters and constructing a compressed version without them. For each word, it calculates and prints the number of removed characters, then sums up these removals across all words.


I learned how to efficiently process and modify strings by detecting and removing consecutive duplicates, along with tracking changes for summary statistics in C.
