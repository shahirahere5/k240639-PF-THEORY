This code creates a diamond pattern in three parts:

Top Part: Stars are printed with decreasing spaces on the outside and increasing spaces inside, widening toward the middle.
Middle Line: Two rows of stars with a big space in between make the widest part of the diamond.
Bottom Part: Stars are printed with increasing spaces on the outside and decreasing spaces inside, narrowing down the diamond.
The size of the diamond depends on the input a.

i learnt pattern printing and analyzing the patterns.
