Problem 2: Even or Odd
Mr. Bhola does not know what an even or odd number is. He is least bothered to learn the difference either. It all comes down to your programming skills to design a program that will ask for a positive number greater than 0 and prints whether the number is even or odd. Be careful, Mr. Bhola can even enter 0 or negative numbers so your solution must give an error saying invalid input in that case.  

IPO CHART:

input: number

process: check if postive number, check whether even or odd

output: even or odd

PSEUDOCODE:
1. input number
2. IF number > 0 then
3. if number % 2 = 0 then
4. print "even"
5. else, print "odd"
