Problem 1: Miles per hour to kilometers per seconds 
This year olympics were held in Europe causing all sorts of problems for the Americans as they donâ€™t use the standard measures like meters and kilometers, grams and kilograms. For racing events the speeds are measured in kilometers per seconds. Can you design a solution to convert kilometers per seconds to miles per hour for US viewers of the Paris Olympics?

IPO CHART:
input:  speed(in_kmph)
process: calculate speed in mph
output: speed(in_mph)

PSEUDOCODE:
1. Input speed(in_kmph).
2. declare a variable named mph.
3. mph = mph * 3600 *0.62
4. output mph

FLOWCHART:
