Approach:
The program uses a structured design with a nested structure to represent employees and their joining dates. Functions are employed to modularize tasks like assigning details and checking tenure. Logical checks ensure accurate tenure calculation by considering the day and month differences.

Learning:
This problem reinforced the importance of structs for data organization and dynamic date calculations for real-world scenarios. Debugging typos also highlighted the value of attention to detail in code.
